\begin{abstract}
  This document demonstrates how to use the \LaTeX2e \verb|acmconf|
  class by exhibiting itself as an example.  You are expected to be
  familiar with~\cite{Lam94}.  The best way to use this file is to use
  it as a template, i.e., replace the prose in it by your
  own\footnote{And may use footnotes.}.

\section{Introduction}
To understand this file read the \emph{source} and not the typeset
version.  If you are reading this in the typeset version you might as
well stop --- it is not supposed to make sense.

\section{The Story Begins\ldots}
A real article is supposed to have some deep results and good
explanations.  That, however, is your job and not mine so you should
replace this text with something more appropriate\footnote{Another a
  footnote}..

Same, a little bit smaller:

\IfFileExists{graphicx.sty}{
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{body.eps}
  }{
  Sorry, package \texttt{graphicx} not present.

\section{Conclusion}
The end, at last!  In this example there really are no results or
points to summarize but I trust your article has more food for though
and thus will need a conclusion.

\section{Appendices}
If you have any, appendices might go here.  Note that appendices
should not be used to circumvent the word count limit.

This is "doing it by hand" --- you might be better off using BibTeX.
